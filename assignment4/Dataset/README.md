# Indian Housing Rent Price Dataset

This dataset contains housing rental data across major Indian cities (Mumbai, Delhi, Pune & Hisar). The data has been preprocessed, cleaned, and split into training and testing sets.

## Dataset Splits

The original data was aggregated from three separate city datasets and combined into a single corpus before splitting to ensure a proportional stratified representation of all cities in both the train and test subsets.

- **`train.csv`**: Contains 11,128 records (80% of the data).
- **`test.csv`**: Contains 2,782 records (20% of the data).
