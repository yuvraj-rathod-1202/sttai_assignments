    "In this lab, you learned:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Label Studio Setup**: Creating annotation interfaces with XML configs\n",
    "2. **Annotation Guidelines**: Writing clear, comprehensive guidelines with edge cases\n",
    "3. **Percent Agreement**: Simple but limited measure of annotator agreement\n",
    "4. **Cohen's Kappa**: Agreement metric that accounts for chance (2 annotators)\n",
    "5. **Fleiss' Kappa**: Extension for multiple annotators\n",
    "6. **IoU**: Measuring agreement for spatial annotations\n",
    "7. **Majority Voting**: Resolving disagreements between annotators\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Kappa >= 0.8** is the target for production annotation tasks\n",
    "- Clear guidelines with examples reduce disagreements\n",
    "- Multiple annotators + adjudication = higher quality labels\n",
    "- Different metrics for different annotation types\n",
